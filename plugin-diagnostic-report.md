**Date:** 2025-10-20
**Plugin Version:** 0.3.0
**Status:** ⚠️ PARTIALLY WORKING

---

## Executive Summary

The `astro-dev` plugin from `sb-marketplace` is **installed and enabled**, but **only the MCP tool is functioning**. The plugin's slash commands, skills, and agents are not accessible in Claude Code despite being properly installed.

---

## Installation Status

### ✅ Plugin Downloaded Successfully

**Location:** `C:\Users\r_lyn\.claude\plugins\marketplaces\sb-marketplace\astro-dev\`

**Source:** GitHub repository `superbenefit/sb-marketplace`

**Last Updated:** 2025-10-20 10:04:08 UTC

### ✅ Plugin Enabled

Both global and local settings confirm the plugin is enabled:
- Global: `~/.claude/settings.json` → `"astro-dev@sb-marketplace": true`
- Local: `.claude/settings.local.json` → `"astro-dev@sb-marketplace": true`

---

## What's Working

### ✅ MCP Tool

**Tool:** `mcp__astro-docs__search_astro_docs`

**Status:** FUNCTIONAL

**Evidence:** Successfully tested and returned comprehensive Astro documentation search results.

**Configuration:** Tool is properly configured in `.mcp.json` and accessible through Claude Code.

---

## What's NOT Working

### ❌ Slash Commands (0/5 accessible)

The plugin provides **5 slash commands** that are NOT accessible:

1. `/architect` - Architecture planning for Astro/Starlight systems
2. `/audit` - Code validation with configurable rigor levels
3. `/develop` - Orchestrated workflow with task analysis
4. `/implement` - Direct implementation bypassing orchestration
5. `/lookup` - Quick API reference and documentation

**Files:** All command files exist at `~/.claude/plugins/marketplaces/sb-marketplace/astro-dev/commands/`

**Error:** When attempting to use `/architect`, user received: "Unknown slash command: architect"

### ❌ Skills (0/2 accessible)

The plugin provides **2 skills** that are NOT accessible:

1. `astro-coding` - Coding patterns and best practices with selective loading
   - Path: `skills/astro-coding/`
   - Includes: SKILL.md and references directory

2. `astro-knowledge` - API documentation and reference lookup
   - Path: `skills/astro-knowledge/`
   - Includes: SKILL.md, docs-index.md, llms.txt, and 2.5MB llms-full.md reference

**Files:** All skill files exist with proper structure

**Issue:** Skills do not appear when checking available skills via the Skill tool

### ❌ Agents (Status Unknown)

The plugin defines **4 custom agents**:

1. `astro-orchestrator` - Coordinates tasks and manages agent workflows
2. `astro-developer` - Handles code implementation for Astro/Starlight projects
3. `astro-auditor` - Validates code with configurable rigor levels
4. `astro-architect` - Plans content architecture and system design

**Files:** All agent files exist at `~/.claude/plugins/marketplaces/sb-marketplace/astro-dev/agents/`

**Issue:** Cannot verify if these agents are available through Claude Code's Task tool, as they don't appear in the standard agent list

---

## Configuration Issues

### ⚠️ Marketplace Source Conflict

**Problem:** Conflicting marketplace source definitions between configuration files.

**Global Settings** (`~/.claude/settings.json`):
```json
"sb-marketplace": {
  "source": {
    "source": "directory",
    "path": "/f/projects/sb-governance-starlight"
  }
}
```

**Local Settings** (`.claude/settings.local.json`):
```json
"sb-marketplace": {
  "source": {
    "source": "github",
    "repo": "superbenefit/sb-marketplace"
  }
}
```

**Known Marketplaces** (`~/.claude/plugins/known_marketplaces.json`):
```json
"sb-marketplace": {
  "source": {
    "source": "github",
    "repo": "superbenefit/sb-marketplace"
  },
  "installLocation": "C:\\Users\\r_lyn\\.claude\\plugins\\marketplaces\\sb-marketplace",
  "lastUpdated": "2025-10-20T10:04:08.448Z"
}
```

**Impact:** The global settings incorrectly point to the current project directory instead of the plugin installation location. This may be causing Claude Code to look for plugin resources in the wrong location.

  "name": "astro-dev",
  "description": "Astro/Starlight development toolkit...",
  "version": "0.3.0",
  "agents": {
    "astro-orchestrator": { "path": "agents/astro-orchestrator.md", ... },
    "astro-developer": { "path": "agents/astro-developer.md", ... },
    "astro-auditor": { "path": "agents/astro-auditor.md", ... },
    "astro-architect": { "path": "agents/astro-architect.md", ... }
  },

## Root Cause Analysis - RESOLVED ✅

### ✅ ACTUAL ROOT CAUSES IDENTIFIED

After thorough investigation comparing against Claude Code documentation and working plugin examples, two critical issues were identified:

#### Issue 1: Missing YAML Frontmatter (CRITICAL)

**Description:** Agent files `astro-developer.md` and `astro-orchestrator.md` were missing required YAML frontmatter.

**Evidence:**
- Claude Code requires all agent files to have YAML frontmatter with `name`, `description`, and optional `model` fields
- Only 2 of 4 agent files had frontmatter (astro-auditor.md, astro-architect.md)
- Official docs: "Agents are stored as Markdown files with YAML frontmatter"

**Impact:** Without frontmatter, Claude Code cannot discover or load these agents

**Status:** ✅ FIXED - Added frontmatter to both files

#### Issue 2: Incorrect plugin.json Schema (CRITICAL)

**Description:** The `commands` and `agents` fields used incorrect object format instead of array/string format.

**Incorrect Format:**
```json
"commands": {
  "develop": "commands/develop.md"
},
"agents": {
  "astro-orchestrator": {
    "path": "agents/astro-orchestrator.md",
    "description": "..."
  }
}
```

**Correct Format:**
```json
"commands": ["./commands/develop.md", ...],  // Array of paths
"agents": "./agents/"  // String path to directory
```

**OR** (preferred for default directories):
```json
// Omit both fields - Claude Code auto-discovers from agents/ and commands/ directories
```

**Evidence:**
- Official docs show array format for commands: `["./custom/commands/special.md"]`
- Official docs show string format for agents: `"./custom/agents/"`
- Our format matched neither specification

**Impact:** Incorrect schema prevented Claude Code from loading commands and agents

**Status:** ✅ FIXED - Removed both fields to enable auto-discovery

### Original Hypotheses - INCORRECT

❌ **Hypothesis 1: Feature Not Implemented** - INCORRECT
- Commands, skills, and agents ARE fully supported in marketplace plugins
- Successful marketplaces like claude-code-plugins-plus prove this works with 227+ plugins

❌ **Hypothesis 2: Configuration Conflict** - PARTIALLY RELEVANT
- Configuration conflict exists but was not the primary cause
- Plugin files were correctly downloaded and in correct location
- The schema issues prevented loading regardless of configuration

❌ **Hypothesis 3: Plugin Schema Incompatibility** - CORRECT BUT INCOMPLETE
- Schema was indeed incompatible, but in specific, fixable ways
- Issues were: missing agent frontmatter + wrong field formats in plugin.json

---

## Actions Taken - RESOLVED ✅

### Fixes Applied (v0.3.1)

1. **✅ Added YAML Frontmatter to Agent Files**
   - Added frontmatter to `astro-developer.md`:
     ```yaml
     ---
     name: astro-developer
     description: Specialized code implementation agent for Astro/Starlight projects. Use for writing components, pages, routes, configurations, and applying best practices.
     model: sonnet
     ---
     ```
   - Added frontmatter to `astro-orchestrator.md`:
     ```yaml
     ---
     name: astro-orchestrator
     description: Intelligent task coordinator for Astro/Starlight workflows. Use for complex tasks requiring multi-agent coordination, task analysis, and execution planning.
     model: sonnet
     ---
     ```

2. **✅ Fixed plugin.json Schema**
   - Removed incorrect `commands` object field
   - Removed incorrect `agents` object field
   - Now relies on auto-discovery from default `commands/` and `agents/` directories
   - All agents and commands will be auto-discovered when plugin loads

### Testing Instructions

After updating to v0.3.1, users should:

1. **Reinstall Plugin**
   ```bash
   # Remove old version
   /plugin remove astro-dev@sb-marketplace

   # Reinstall fresh
   /plugin install astro-dev@sb-marketplace
   ```

2. **Test Slash Commands**
   ```bash
   /develop Create a simple component
   /architect Design a blog system
   /implement Add a Header component
   /audit src/components/
   /lookup getCollection
   ```

3. **Verify Agent Loading**
   - Agents should auto-invoke based on task context
   - Check that agents appear in Task tool when invoked

4. **Verify Skills Loading**
   - Skills should activate automatically when relevant
   - `astro-coding` and `astro-knowledge` should load on-demand

### Expected Results

All plugin functionality should now work correctly:
- ✅ 5 slash commands accessible
- ✅ 4 agents invokable via Task tool
- ✅ 2 skills auto-activate based on context
- ✅ MCP tool continues working (was already functional)

---

## Additional Notes

### MCP Tool Configuration

The `.mcp.json` file successfully configures the Astro documentation search tool:

```json
{
  "tools": {
    "search_astro_docs": {
      "description": "Search the official Astro framework docs",
      ...
    }
  }
}
```

This proves the plugin installation and basic integration works correctly.

### Plugin Permissions

The plugin has proper permissions configured in `.claude/settings.local.json`:

```json
"permissions": {
  "allow": [
    "mcp__astro-docs__search_astro_docs"
  ]
}
```

---

## Conclusion

The `astro-dev` plugin is **correctly installed** but **incompletely functional**. The MCP tool integration works perfectly, demonstrating that the plugin system can access marketplace plugins. However, commands, skills, and agents from marketplace plugins do not appear to be loading in Claude Code.

**Next Step:** Fix the configuration conflict in `~/.claude/settings.json` and test again. If commands/skills still don't work, this likely represents a limitation or bug in Claude Code's marketplace plugin system that should be reported to the development team.
