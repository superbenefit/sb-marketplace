## [0.2.0] - 2025-10-18

### Added

#### Agents
- **astro-orchestrator**: Intelligent task coordinator with complexity analysis
  - Agent coordination and parallel execution
  - Audit rigor calibration (auto/light/medium/comprehensive)
  - Token optimization via selective loading
  - Task analysis and execution planning

#### Commands
- **/develop**: Orchestrated workflow (primary command for 90% of tasks)
- **/architect**: Architecture planning without implementation
- Adaptive **/audit** levels: auto, light, medium, comprehensive

#### Features
- Progressive disclosure pattern for knowledge loading
- Knowledge base consolidation (17 files → 5 files, ~50% token reduction)
- Parallel agent execution when beneficial
- Selective pattern loading based on task keywords
- 3-priority validation system (P1: Breaking, P2: Security, P3: Best practices)

### Changed

#### Breaking Changes
- **/docs-lookup** command renamed to **/lookup**
- **astro-developer** skill renamed to **astro-coding**
- **astro-docs** skill renamed to **astro-knowledge**
- Auto-audit hooks removed (manual `/audit` preferred for user control)

#### Skills Reorganization
- **astro-coding**: Implementation patterns with selective loading
- **astro-knowledge**: API documentation and reference lookup

#### Knowledge Base
- Consolidated into 5 core files (~1500 lines total):
  - `error-catalog.md` - Indexed by symptom
  - `astro-patterns.md` - Components, routing, collections
  - `starlight-guide.md` - Starlight-specific features
  - `integrations.md` - Loaders, external data, TypeScript
  - `content-knowledge/` - Detailed references

### Improved
- Token usage reduced by ~50% through consolidation
- Task complexity analysis algorithm
- Rigor calibration for appropriate validation depth
- Documentation organization and clarity

### Removed
- Redundant knowledge base files (17 → 5)
- Auto-audit hooks (replaced with explicit `/audit` command)
- Broken components (Phase 4a cleanup)

## Release Notes

### Version 0.2.0 - Orchestration Architecture

Initial development release introducing orchestration-based architecture with intelligent task coordination.

**Key Improvements**:
- Orchestrator-driven workflows with automatic task analysis
- Adaptive validation rigor based on task complexity
- Consolidated knowledge base with selective loading
- Parallel agent execution when beneficial

**Note**: This is an initial development version (v0.x). Breaking changes may occur frequently as the plugin evolves toward v1.0 stability.

**Migration from v0.1.0**:
- Replace `/docs-lookup` with `/lookup`
- Use `/develop` as primary command (replaces direct `/implement` for most tasks)
- Invoke `astro-coding` skill instead of `astro-developer`
- Invoke `astro-knowledge` skill instead of `astro-docs`
- Use explicit `/audit` command (auto-hooks removed)

### Version 0.1.0 - Initial Implementation

Internal development version with basic agent system and comprehensive knowledge base.

### Compatibility

- **Claude Code**: Latest version
- **Astro**: v4.x and later
- **Starlight**: v0.21.x and later
